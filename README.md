# 🌍 World Happiness Report Analysis (2015–2019)  
This project analyzes the World Happiness Report datasets from 2015 to 2019. The dataset contains country-level happiness scores and contributing factors such as GDP, social support, life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and corruption.

The goal is to clean, normalize, and align data across years, calculate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and visualize how different factors impact happiness.

## Dataset Description
The World Happiness Report dataset is released every year. Each file contains country-wise happiness scores and related factors.

## Problems in the dataset:

Column names are different every year  
Some values are missing  
Data needs to be combined for analysis  
I solve these problems using simple cleaning and basic logic.
